## Database of Asteroid Models from Inversion Techniques (DAMIT) - iOS release

DAMIT contains asteroid models that were derived using the light-curve inversion method developed by Kaasalainen & Torppa (2001) and Kaasalainen et al. (2001), combined with other inversion techniques in some cases. Each model in DAMIT references the original paper(s) where it was published. Please note that the models presented in DAMIT may differ from those published in the original papers. The main reason for this is a limited dataset used in the original publication and/or a narrow range of periods scanned during the inversion.
